This is a simple website for the archieMGS project to **display what we're about** and to give people the opportunity to reach out to us **for questions** and other things. This website is still a WIP, so expect the aestetics to change, we haven't quite nailed that down.

This website may also display recent updates on the project in the future.. *we'll see where this goes*. :)
